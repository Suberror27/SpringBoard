// ## Step 1 ðŸ§© Caesar remembers he forgot to add his best friend "BRUTUS" to the list. Add him to the beginning of the list.
guests.unshift("BRUTUS");

// ## Question 1 ðŸ¤” How can you verify that "BRUTUS" was added to the beginning of the array?
// We can console.log() the array to verify BRUTUS is now inside and in the first spot of the array.

// ## Step 2 ðŸ§© A herald announced the arrival of "AUGUSTUS" and "LUCIA". Add them to the end of the guest list.
guests.push("AUGUSTUS", "LUCIA");

// ## Step 3 ðŸ§© Caesar is curious. He wants to know if "SPARTACUS" has been invited. Check if he's on the list and find out at which position.
const spartacusCheck = guests.includes("SPARTACUS"); // Returns false because SPARTACUS is not on the list :(

// ## Question 2 ðŸ¤” What would the value of `spartacusIndex` be if "SPARTACUS" wasn't invited?
// It would be -1 becuase it does not exist on the array

// ## Step 4 ðŸ§© Oops! Caesar just received a message that "CASSIUS" won't be able to make it. Remove him from the list.

// ## Step 5 ðŸ§© Caesar wants to send a special invite to the first three guests on the list. Extract these names into a new array.
const firstThreeGuests = guests.slice(0, 3);

// ## Step 6 ðŸ§© Caesar decides he wants the guest list in alphabetical order. Sort the array. 
// However, Caesar wants his most honored guest (the one added first) to remain at the top of the list. 
// Can you think of a way to sort the guests but keep the honored ones at the top?
const splitBrutus = guests.slice(0, 1); // We first remove Brutus for later on set him up front on the list
const splitOtherGuests = guests.slice(1) // We grab the rest of the guests
